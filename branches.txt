master is connected to origin (blulady)
upstream_master is connected to upstream (WWCODE-SV) 
upstream_master needs to be wiped and recreated
actually the whole local repo needs to be wiped and redown loaded

class Invitee(models.Model):
    email = models.EmailField(max_length=254, null=False, blank=False, unique=True)
    message = models.TextField(null=False, blank=False)
    registration_token = models.CharField(max_length=150, default='#deftoken#')

    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

email -included with User Model
message -not on any User model
registration_token - is this the same as the RegistrationToken model?
accepted - does this need to be set to anything (it says a boolean, I imagine it would be set to false until they accept the invite?
created_at -does this need to come from RegestrationToken attribute
updated_at -   does this need to come from RegestrationToken attribute
