I noticed that we are passing around a secret key in github via .env.example, is 
this best practices?

'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'
'a+ah#!5(!&j#bbv065oyfypm#2a3$inb8mh*5n#+pgz0%fz)'\

some underlined issues in api.urls.py

In the video tutorial on django rest frame work, we are interacting with 
the drf user interface (default page for the api to create a post request.
Is this how the easter egg is supposed to be interacted with?

implimented permissions, all api's have to be authenticated, give permission as allow any
every view will have permission classes permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated] use [AllowAny] instead
or run all the files in fixtures (see readme in repo)

run fixtures run the command 
docker-compose exec web bash
./manage.py loaddata api/fixtures/resources_data.json
./manage.py loaddata api/fixtures/roles_data.json
./manage.py loaddata api/fixtures/teams_data.json
./manage.py loaddata api/fixtures/users_data.json
or can use a docker extension pycharm

good to swager signin as director
grab access token from swagger sign in
accessing apis from swagger (user neeeds to be authenticated)
